      "description": "Slope is susceptible to rainfall-induced failure after being damaged by earthquake. In this study, the seepage and deformation of unsaturated slope during post-earthquake rainfall were investigated using the finite element method. Shaking-induced plastic modulus reduction dependent on deviatoric strain and shaking-induced permeability change dependent on volumetric strain were considered in the modeling of slope response to the following rainfall; the damage concept was adopted to describe shaking-induced cracks and assess the impact of surface cracks on permeability enhancement and strength reduction. Then, numerical modeling of the hydro-mechanical response of slope to rainfall was performed with the updated model. Analysis showed that earthquake significantly affected the slip surface of slope subjected to the following rainfall since soil with reduced shear modulus further deformed, causing a more severe landslide, whereas the influence of earthquake-induced permeability reduction was not great; earthquake-induced damage should be incorporated in the analysis of slope response to rainfall since it altered landslide characteristics. Analysis was generally consistent with centrifuge experiments based on the discussions of pore water pressure, stress path, slope deformation, and soil displacement in simulations and experiments. The coupled hydro-mechanical analysis with the proposed modeling methods could evaluate the response of unsaturated slope to post-earthquake rainfall.",

      "description": "<p>In this study, a finite element (FE) analysis is conducted to investigate the effects of corrosion in tensile reinforcement on the shear performance of reinforced concrete (RC) members. In this regard, a multiscale chemo-hygral computational system is adopted, and its rationality is verified by comparing the FE analysis results with the shear test results of corroded RC beams. Based on the verified FE model, a parametric analysis is performed to examine the static shear and long-term behaviors of RC members according to the corrosion damage. The analysis results show that when the tensile reinforcement is simply straight anchored in the member, the ratio of reduction in shear strength due to corrosion decreases with the shear span-to-depth ratio. Meanwhile, when the tensile reinforcement is fully anchored, the shear strength of the corroded member increases owing to the formation of arch action despite the occurrence of splitting cracks caused by corrosion, and this tendency is more prominent as the shear span-to-depth ratio decreases. In terms of the long-term behavior of corroded RC members, it is shown that as corrosion progresses gradually over time, failure occurs with a rapid increase in deflection, including at low sustained load levels.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Platform-based product development has been regarded as a cost-efficient approach to handle wide product variety. The key to successful platform-based product development is finding the best combination of the platform configuration and modular design. Most research papers have focused on product platform configuration with a given module set without considering operation costs including the design cost, procurement costs and inventory costs. A new model is proposed in order to determine the optimal product platform configuration for a given external product family considering the vertical and horizontal selection of a module with multiple options and operation costs. The demand for the external product family is unknown, and normal distribution has been assumed. The module acquisition lead time varies along with the module acquisition amount and the transportation time. A hybrid methodology combining a simulated annealing and VNS (variable neighborhood search) is proposed and applied to solve the proposed model. Numerical examination was carried out for the purpose of evaluation. The results show that the proposed model can provide an optimal solution. This research makes two main contributions: the vertical and horizontal selection process of module options and the consideration of operation cost of module acquisition in product platform configuration.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Swirling flow tundish was developed to enhance the coalescence of inclusions, so as to deeply clean the liquid steel. Inclusions would gather to the center of the swirling flow by centripetal force, due to the density difference between inclusions and liquid steel. Thus, small inclusions can coalesce into larger ones, and then float to the free surface by their self-buoyance. Physical experiments were carried out in a 1/2.5 scale single strand tundish to study the flow characteristics of tundish with swirling chamber. Numerical modeling was developed to simulate the movements of small inclusions in swirling flow. Discrete phase model was employed together with the O’Rourke algorithm to characterize the coalescence of the inclusions in the swirling flow. The removal of inclusions was investigated, considering the absorption by upper slag and trapping by outside wall of ladle shroud. Compared with a turbulence inhibitor, a swirling chamber shows a similar effect on flow improvement, while performs better in inclusion removal, owing to the inclusion coalescence caused by centripetal force. The results revealed that swirling chamber in diameter of 450 mm is an optimized scheme for deep cleaning of liquid steel, with only 1.66% of the inclusions flowing out of the tundish nozzle.</p>",

One, two, and three vortexes were generated under the flow pattern of single roll flow, double roll flow, and complex roll flow, respectively. The vortex center position migrated from the meniscus to the submerged entry nozzle in the upper recirculation zone and moved downward along the mold height in the lower recirculation zone with the increasing of the casting speed, respectively. With the increasing of the argon flow rate, the movement trajectory of vortex center was opposite to the increasing of the casting speed. The vortex center position moved from the meniscus to the submerged entry nozzle with the outport angle of submerged entry nozzle increased and migrated from the submerged entry nozzle to the meniscus with mold width increased. In addition, nonlinear fitting for the maximum velocity of the molten steel at the top surface under different cast parameters was performed, and the regression equation was verified by nail board measurements The on-line prediction of the maximum velocity at the top surface was realized.</p>",

In this study, the authors focus on the case of a company that is introducing a membership stage system. Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is well-known as an analytical model for analysis of co-occurrence of variables in data. However, the relationship between customers and items for the customer purchase behavior of each stage based on PLSA has not shown good performance. The purchase behaviors may be slightly different between customer stages, and accordingly, the purchase behavior of customers in different stages should be represented by a similar but different model. In addition, the higher the membership stage, the fewer customers there are; therefore, it becomes difficult to accurately understand the features of the customers' purchase behavior within high membership stages. In this study, the authors propose a learning algorithm that utilizes the estimated parameters of the behavior model based on the PLSA model at a lower-stage, to estimate the parameters of models at a higher-stage to which few people belong. Moreover, numerical simulation experiments are conducted and compared to actual purchase history data to confirm the performance of the proposed method.</p>",

The effects of powder injection speed, solid-gas ratio, particle size, and injection position on the trajectory and residence time of particles in the molten pool are studied. The discrete phase and continuous phase coupling solution method is used to analyze the change of the molten pool flow field after powder injection. It is found that increasing the spraying rate can reduce the particle concentration near the liquid surface from 2.3 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1.18 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Increasing the solid-gas ratio from 10 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 30 kg/m<sup>3</sup> can increase the powder distribution ratio from 70.9% to 93.1%. The larger the size of the particles, the easier it is to stay near the liquid level, and the maximum can reach 2.13 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Finally, it was also found that spraying powder at 0.7 R can make the powder more uniformly distributed in the molten pool.</p>",

Moreover, previous research evaluated its regulation ability and economic valuation through numerical case studies with expected transaction prices of the reserve market. This paper conducts the cost evaluation of hydrogen supply by electrolyzer in microgrid under optimization in ideal conditions based on time-series data of actual transaction prices in supplemental reserve market in Transmission and Distribution Grid Council (TDGC) in addition to the spot market in Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX). Moreover, this paper discusses the expected benefits of hydrogen supply with electrolyzer given by the reform from the current transaction system in electricity and reserve markets. The simulation result implies that participating in reserve markets while operating under the proposed method can save hydrogen supply costs. However, since the saved price of hydrogen supply cost also is not achieved to government target, power system reform, such as renewable energy surcharge exemption and consignment fee discount for hydrogen production equipment, is required.",

    //   "description": "<p>Low-Temperature Superconductors (LTS) are sensitive to non-uniform current distribution, which produces quenching. So, transposition of strands is indispensable in LTS cables to help current redistribution. In contrast, High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) have higher thermal stability, which is expected to help current redistribution among strands (tapes) without quenching. Generally, HTS cable designs consider transposition to reduce quench likelihood and better handling AC operation. However, transposition causes mechanical strain in the tapes, reducing their performance. Recently, a 20-kA-class Stacked Tapes Assembled in Rigid Structure (STARS) conductor is being developed at NIFS, for the next-generation helical devices. To weigh the simple stacking feasibility of HTS tapes, a previous experiment confirmed, that 5 non-transposed HTS tapes can stably conduct a worst-case non-uniform current distribution without quenching. This further suggests that when using HTS tapes for DC HTS cables, transposition may be optional, but not strictly required. A numerical simulation was developed, dealing with the current distribution among the HTS tapes in a worst-case scenario, reproducing the previous experimental observation, and a second experiment was performed to give insights into the contact resistance between HTS tapes. The self-magnetic field effect and temperature fluctuations are to be explored for quench scenarios.</p>",

    //   "description": "The safe management and disposal of radioactive wastes are of critical importance for maintaining a sustainable society. In nuclear waste management, cement and concrete are commonly used to immobilize radioactive waste. Cementation is a common technique used for conditioning low-level and intermediate-level radioactive wastes, which should ensure safe interim storage of waste packages and act as a first long-term barrier during waste disposal. In addition, cement-based materials are utilized for construction and barrier materials in surface disposals for very low-level to low-level waste and deep geological disposals for low-level, intermediate-level, and high-level wastes. Furthermore, recovery from the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (F1NPS) is an important and urgent issue in Japan. To solve the difficult problems associated with radioactive contaminated materials in the plant and in the environment, contributions of cement and concrete technologies are highly expected.\nThe understanding end prediction of the long-term evolution of cement materials interacting with wastes and other barrier materials during interim and final storage is indispensable and needs to be studied by experts from different scientific and engineering disciplines. The very long times associated with the safe disposal of radioactive waste, which are well beyond the lifetime of ordinal engineered structures and therefore not experimentally accessible, make this task even more demanding.\nn the first part of this special issue, three technical contributions summarize research and development projects for nuclear waste management with cement and concrete technologies in Japan. Nakarai et al. (20-359) and Ichikawa and Hamamoto (19-1275) give general overviews on the use of cement-based materials for low-level radioactive waste (LLW) and for high-level radioactive waste (HLW), respectively. Furthermore, Abe and Iida (20-236) present a comparative discussion of approaches used for LLW in Japan and Belgium. \nIn the second part, the contributions concentrate on processes and applications related to the performance assessment of cement and concrete for nuclear waste management. The scientific papers describe sorption experiments with Cl, I, HTO, and C by Nedyalkova et al. (19-811), diffusion experiments with NaCl of leached cement paste by Kurmisawa et al. (19-426), leaching experiments of cement paste with quick setting admixture by Yokozeki et al. (19-1173), immersion experiments of cement-bentonite samples by Nakarai et al. (19-433, 19-447), and chemo-mechanical modelling of degraded concrete by Oda et al. (19-1075). \nFinally, the third part contains contributions that investigate, in a broad sense, how cement and concrete technologies can be used to deal with the aftermath of the F1NPS nuclear disaster. At first, a technical paper by Igarashi et al. (19-950) summarizes the outcome of a research initiative that aimed at identifying the cause and extent of radioactive contamination of concrete at the F1NPS. \nA set of scientific contributions is related to water absorption tests and numerical analysis with a simple moisture transport modeling by Kiran et al. (18-588, 19-168), sorption experiments with Cs and Sr and thermodynamic equilibrium model by Tomita et al. (19-1061), molecular dynamics simulations of Cs sorption by Duque-Redondo et al. (19-95), characterization of calcium aluminate cement containing SrCl2 by Mohammed et al. (19-1296), and diffusion experiments with Cs and Sr by Yamada et al. (19-756).\nThe broad research topics presented in this special issue emphasized the importance of cement and concrete technologies to solve the ongoing issues of radioactive waste management, including F1NPS decommissioning and environmental recovery from radionuclide contamination.",

    //   "description": "<p>This paper presents a novel parametrization strategy for optimal contouring control of flexible feed drives. The aim of the new strategy is to maximize the structural damping of the drive and counteract the deformations of the structure. Using a simplified flexible multibody model, the analytical relationships for the design of velocity and position control gains were derived. This results in a controller bandwidth increase of up to 20% compared to the previous state-of-the-art in parametrization of standard cascaded controllers. Through analytical and numerical calculations, it was demonstrated that such an increase is feasible without a decrease in structural damping if the position and velocity controller gains are both considered. Furthermore, it is shown that the ratio between the position and velocity loop gains influences the quasistatic deformation between the encoder and tool center point (TCP). A formula for the optimal choice of the ratio was derived to compensate for the error.  This leads to a new straightforward step-by-step approach for axis controller setting, which is then applied to a test bench and its simulation model. It can be shown that the new parametrization strategy leads to a significant reduction in path error at the TCP. Importantly, the analytical approach should simplify the task of setting up a standard cascaded controller significantly by avoiding time-consuming iterations.</p>",

The model has been used in the room-average analysis of infection risk and analysis using passive scalars as a proxy for aerosol transport. However, it has not been employed for risk estimation in numerical simulations of droplet dispersion. In this work, we develop a framework for the evaluation of the probability of infection in droplet dispersion simulations using the dose-response model. We introduce a version of the model that can incorporate the higher transmissibility of variant strains of SARS-CoV2 and the effect of vaccination in evaluating the probability of infection. Numerical simulations of droplet dispersion during speech are carried out to investigate the infection risk over space and time using the model. The advantage of droplet dispersion simulations for risk evaluation is demonstrated through the analysis of the effect of ambient wind, humidity on infection risk, and through a comparison with risk evaluation based on passive scalars as a proxy for aerosol transport.",

If random failures occur, the required capacities for virtual machines are allocated to the dedicated backup physical machines, which are determined in advance. We consider two uncertainties: failure event and virtual machine capacity. By adopting a robust optimization technique, we formulate six mixed integer linear programming problems. Numerical results show that for a small size problem, our presented models are applicable to the case that virtual machine capacities are uncertain, and by using these models, we can obtain the optimal solution of the allocation of virtual machines under the uncertainty. A simulated annealing heuristic is presented to solve large size problems. By using this heuristic, an approximate solution is obtained for a large size problem.</p>",

    //   "description": "<p>Manufacturers are coping with increasing pressures in quality, cost and efficiency as more and more industries are moving from traditional setup to industry 4.0 based digitally transformed setup due to its numerous playbacks. Within the manufacturing domain organizational structures and processes are complex, therefore adopting industry 4.0 and finding an optimized re-engineered business process is difficult without using a systematic methodology. Authors have developed Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) and Business Process Optimization (BPO) methods but no consolidated methodology have been seen in the literature that is based on industry 4.0 and incorporates both the BPR and BPO. We have presented a consolidated and systematic re-engineering and optimization framework for a manufacturing industry setup. The proposed framework performs Evolutionary Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). An example process from an aircraft manufacturing factory has been optimized and re-engineered with available set of technologies from industry 4.0 based on the criteria of lower cost, reduced processing time and reduced error rate. At the end to validate the proposed framework Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is used for simulations and perform comparison between AS-IS and TO-BE processes as it is widely used standard for business process specification. The proposed framework will be used in converting an industry from traditional setup to industry 4.0 resulting in cost reduction, increased performance and quality.</p>",

    //   "description": "<p>As known to us all, L-shaped co-prime array (LCA) is a recently introduced two-dimensional (2-D) sparse array structure, which is extended from linear co-prime array (CA). Such sparse array geometry can be used for 2-D parameters estimation with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF). However, in the scenario where several narrowband transmissions spread over a wide spectrum, existing technique based on LCA with Nyquist sampling may encounter a bottleneck for both analog and digital processing. To alleviate the burden of high-rate Nyquist sampling, a method of joint wideband spectrum and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with compressed sampling based on LCA, which is recognized as LCA-based modulated wideband converter (MWC), is presented in this work. First, the received signal along each antenna is mixed to basebands, low-pass filtered and down-sampled to get the compressed sampling data. Then by constructing the virtual received data of 2-D difference coarray, we estimate the wideband spectrum and DOA jointly using two recovery methods where the first is a joint ESPRIT method and the other is a joint CS method. Numerical simulations illustrate the validity of the proposed LCA based MWC system and show the superiority.</p>",
