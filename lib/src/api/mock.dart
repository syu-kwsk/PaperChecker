      "description": "In this paper, we perform a complete analysis on a degenerated reaction–diffusion cholera model with stabilizing total humans and non-mobility of cholera bacteria in a spatially heterogeneous bounded domain. The existence of a global attractor is established through introducing the Kuratowski measure of non-compactness. The basic reproduction number and its equivalent characterizations have been used to analyze the threshold-type results, where the persistence and extinction of cholera can also be characterized by the dispersal rate of infected humans. In the homogeneous case, the global attractivity of the unique positive equilibrium is achieved by the Lyapunov function. Moreover, we compare the basic reproduction numbers for the models without and with considering the mobility of cholera bacteria. Our results suggest that: the basic reproduction numbers attain different values as the dispersal rates of infected humans and cholera approach to infinity, while they attain the same value as the dispersal rates of infected humans and cholera approach to zero. Numerical simulations support our analytical results and discuss the impact of the dispersal rate of infected humans on the transmission of cholera.",

      "description": "Slope is susceptible to rainfall-induced failure after being damaged by earthquake. In this study, the seepage and deformation of unsaturated slope during post-earthquake rainfall were investigated using the finite element method. Shaking-induced plastic modulus reduction dependent on deviatoric strain and shaking-induced permeability change dependent on volumetric strain were considered in the modeling of slope response to the following rainfall; the damage concept was adopted to describe shaking-induced cracks and assess the impact of surface cracks on permeability enhancement and strength reduction. Then, numerical modeling of the hydro-mechanical response of slope to rainfall was performed with the updated model. Analysis showed that earthquake significantly affected the slip surface of slope subjected to the following rainfall since soil with reduced shear modulus further deformed, causing a more severe landslide, whereas the influence of earthquake-induced permeability reduction was not great; earthquake-induced damage should be incorporated in the analysis of slope response to rainfall since it altered landslide characteristics. Analysis was generally consistent with centrifuge experiments based on the discussions of pore water pressure, stress path, slope deformation, and soil displacement in simulations and experiments. The coupled hydro-mechanical analysis with the proposed modeling methods could evaluate the response of unsaturated slope to post-earthquake rainfall.",

      "description": "<p>This study applied the numerical simulations of lava flows to evaluate the damage caused by volcanic hazards. The accuracy of the numerical simulation was governed by the reliability of the input parameters in the numerical models. One of the most important parameters is the information pertaining to terrain data, which is generally provided as a digital elevation model (DEM). The recently-developed 8K technology, mainly applied in the broadcasting field, provides a precise photographic survey of the terrain and can produce a detailed digital topographic map. The Japan Broadcasting Cooperation (NHK) deployed an 8K drone to generate a digital elevation model of Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. These data were used to formulate the lava flow under certain prescribed conditions. This study analyzes the influence of DEM mesh size on lava flow simulations, showing that high-precision DEM outlines the distribution of inundated areas in detail. Moreover, a smaller mesh resulted in a faster arrival time of the lava flow. The study’s results are useful for both risk and crisis management.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Since Japan has 111 active volcanoes, we living there need to be prepared for the volcanic disasters that we will likely encounter in our lifetime. The Integrated Program for Next Generation Volcano Research and Human Resource Development (INeVRH), a research project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), started in 2016 and is now in its 7th year. It is approaching its final stage will be ready to make proposals that will improve our knowledge from both scientific and practical points of view. In theme A, the Japan Volcanic Data Network (JVDN) system started its function as a volcanic research platform, providing the observation and analysis data of many universities, governmental agencies, and institutes. The JVDN system promotes collaborative, multidisciplinary study. In theme B, many strategic observation techniques now deployed have revealed the characteristics of volcanoes in detail. For example, a dense seismic and magnetic survey has clarified the fine structure of the hydrothermal system beneath volcanoes, providing information that can be used to evaluate their phreatic eruption potential. In addition, brand-new volcanic gas observation techniques using drones now obtain in-situ information effectively. Theme C has obtained geologic and petrologic findings at many volcanoes and has come to the stage in which systematic compilation of this database would be useful to comparative studies of many volcanoes. These findings are also used in numerical simulations that combine geologic, petrologic, and geophysical formulations to produce more comprehensive models used to interpret volcanic activity. Theme D focuses on the development of practical technologies for volcanic disaster mitigation, mainly related to volcanic ash. A scheme for the quick detection and evaluation of volcanic ash is proposed through observation and numerical simulation, and an experiment is performed to reveal the thickness threshold of volcanic ash deposits on air-conditioners. This special issue reports on some up-to-date topics that could become the basis of dynamic and effective links between themes A, B, C, and D, which may serve as a base and direction for discussions that summarize and conclude this 10-year project.</p>",

      "description": "<p>A preliminary consideration is conducted on the amount of vertically falling volcanic ash sucked into the horizontal air intakes of the exterior device for air conditioning (AC) using a numerical calculation code consisting of transport equations of airborne ash concentration, equations of motion of ash particles, and a simplified airflow model. This study focuses on the effect of the inertia force acting on the ash particle on the process of ash ingress into the horizontal air intake of AC. The results with the ash particle of sphericity 0.8 indicate that the inertia force reduces the amount of the ash ingress into the air intake by 22, 31, and 51% for the diameters of 67.5, 125, and 250 μm, respectively, as compared to the case neglecting the inertia force. The ashfall depths (thickness of deposited ash) derived as the ones leading to reduction of the performances of AC from our previous laboratory experiment on an open-type cooling tower are re-evaluated with the code. The results suggest that the ashfall depth affecting AC performances can be larger by a factor of 1.6 to 2.1, depending on the particle sphericity, than that obtained in the experiment where the inertia force was neglected in the conversion from the ash amount provided to the test piece to the “actual” ashfall depth. Simulations on the effect of installing a hood over the air intake are also made, indicating limited but substantial reduction of the expected ash ingress. The importance of mitigating ashfall impacts is stressed.</p>",

An open-source numerical depth-averaged model of dense granular currents controlled by physical processes such as energy dissipation, basal deposition, and erosion (faSavageHutterFOAM) was applied to investigate the basal concentrated region of a dome-collapse PDC generated on June 3, 1991 at Unzen volcano (Japan) to assess the effects of the physical processes (and their interplay) on the flow dynamics and run-out area of the PDC. Numerical simulations show that energy dissipation process decreases the flow velocity and increases the basal deposition rate, which reduces the run-out distance. The simulations also reveal that erosion process during flow propagation decreases the flow velocity and increases the run-out distance. The numerical results are sensitive to the parameters of energy dissipation (dry friction coefficient μ and collisional or turbulent friction coefficient χ) and erosion (specific erosion energy e<sub>b</sub>). The results are fitted to field data for run-out distance and flow velocity when μ is between 0.01 and 0.1 with χ∼10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-2</sup> (or when χ is between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-2</sup> with μ∼0.2) and e<sub>b</sub>∼10<sup>2</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>. The estimated value of e<sub>b</sub> suggests that re-entrainment of deposit mass played an important role in controlling the flow dynamics and run-out area of the PDC. The estimated values of μ and χ are correlated, but the estimation of these parameters might be improved by further constraints from field data. The presented results serve as a basis to make further quantitative estimations of the model parameters (μ, χ, and e<sub>b</sub>) for applying the faSavageHutterFOAM model to hazard assessments of PDCs.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Numerical simulation is a useful method for studying the magmatic-hydrothermal systems of volcanoes. However, no comprehensive scheme has been established for constructing subsurface permeability structures that have a significant impact on fluid flow within the volcano. In this study, as a first step to establishing such a scheme, numerical simulations of hydrothermal fluid flow incorporating the heterogeneous properties of the permeability structure were performed utilizing the resistivity structure observed at Kusatsu-Shirane Volcano, central Japan. Although the constructed permeability structure was relatively simple, the simulation results closely reproduced some observations, such as the broad resistivity structure and the distribution and discharge patterns of hot springs around the volcano. These results suggest that the uncertainty in generating permeability structures in hydrothermal fluid flow simulations can be greatly reduced by using resistivity structures.</p>",

      "description": "For more than a century, Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) has been used to explain the process of crystallization in supersaturated solutions. According to CNT, nucleation is a single-step process that occurs via monomer-by-monomer addition.\nHowever, recent findings from experiments and numerical simulations have shown that nucleation is a multi-step process that occurs via more complex pathways that involve intermediate species such as ion complexes, dense liquid precursors, or even nanocrystals. Such non-classical pathways observed in protein solutions, colloidal suspensions and electrolytes are reviewed in this paper. The formation of stable Pre-nucleation Clusters (PNCs) in the crystallization of biominerals is also discussed. In spite of the mounting evidence for non-classical nucleation behaviors, the knowledge about the structural evolution of the intermediate phases and their role in polymorph selection is still limited. It has also been observed that gravitational force interferes with the crystallization behavior of materials thereby posing limitation to ground-based experiments. Microgravity conditions, coupled with containerless processing techniques provide a suitable alternative to overcome these limitations.",

In this regard, a multiscale chemo-hygral computational system is adopted, and its rationality is verified by comparing the FE analysis results with the shear test results of corroded RC beams. Based on the verified FE model, a parametric analysis is performed to examine the static shear and long-term behaviors of RC members according to the corrosion damage. The analysis results show that when the tensile reinforcement is simply straight anchored in the member, the ratio of reduction in shear strength due to corrosion decreases with the shear span-to-depth ratio. Meanwhile, when the tensile reinforcement is fully anchored, the shear strength of the corroded member increases owing to the formation of arch action despite the occurrence of splitting cracks caused by corrosion, and this tendency is more prominent as the shear span-to-depth ratio decreases. In terms of the long-term behavior of corroded RC members, it is shown that as corrosion progresses gradually over time, failure occurs with a rapid increase in deflection, including at low sustained load levels.</p>",

The key to successful platform-based product development is finding the best combination of the platform configuration and modular design. Most research papers have focused on product platform configuration with a given module set without considering operation costs including the design cost, procurement costs and inventory costs. A new model is proposed in order to determine the optimal product platform configuration for a given external product family considering the vertical and horizontal selection of a module with multiple options and operation costs. The demand for the external product family is unknown, and normal distribution has been assumed. The module acquisition lead time varies along with the module acquisition amount and the transportation time. A hybrid methodology combining a simulated annealing and VNS (variable neighborhood search) is proposed and applied to solve the proposed model. Numerical examination was carried out for the purpose of evaluation. The results show that the proposed model can provide an optimal solution. This research makes two main contributions: the vertical and horizontal selection process of module options and the consideration of operation cost of module acquisition in product platform configuration.</p>",

Inclusions would gather to the center of the swirling flow by centripetal force, due to the density difference between inclusions and liquid steel. Thus, small inclusions can coalesce into larger ones, and then float to the free surface by their self-buoyance. Physical experiments were carried out in a 1/2.5 scale single strand tundish to study the flow characteristics of tundish with swirling chamber. Numerical modeling was developed to simulate the movements of small inclusions in swirling flow. Discrete phase model was employed together with the O’Rourke algorithm to characterize the coalescence of the inclusions in the swirling flow. The removal of inclusions was investigated, considering the absorption by upper slag and trapping by outside wall of ladle shroud. Compared with a turbulence inhibitor, a swirling chamber shows a similar effect on flow improvement, while performs better in inclusion removal, owing to the inclusion coalescence caused by centripetal force. The results revealed that swirling chamber in diameter of 450 mm is an optimized scheme for deep cleaning of liquid steel, with only 1.66% of the inclusions flowing out of the tundish nozzle.</p>",

The vortex center position migrated from the meniscus to the submerged entry nozzle in the upper recirculation zone and moved downward along the mold height in the lower recirculation zone with the increasing of the casting speed, respectively. With the increasing of the argon flow rate, the movement trajectory of vortex center was opposite to the increasing of the casting speed. The vortex center position moved from the meniscus to the submerged entry nozzle with the outport angle of submerged entry nozzle increased and migrated from the submerged entry nozzle to the meniscus with mold width increased.

      "description": "<p>In recent years, it has become common to analyze purchase history data and take advantage of the effect on business policies. In this study, the authors focus on the case of a company that is introducing a membership stage system. Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is well-known as an analytical model for analysis of co-occurrence of variables in data. However, the relationship between customers and items for the customer purchase behavior of each stage based on PLSA has not shown good performance. The purchase behaviors may be slightly different between customer stages, and accordingly, the purchase behavior of customers in different stages should be represented by a similar but different model. In addition, the higher the membership stage, the fewer customers there are; therefore, it becomes difficult to accurately understand the features of the customers' purchase behavior within high membership stages. In this study, the authors propose a learning algorithm that utilizes the estimated parameters of the behavior model based on the PLSA model at a lower-stage, to estimate the parameters of models at a higher-stage to which few people belong. Moreover, numerical simulation experiments are conducted and compared to actual purchase history data to confirm the performance of the proposed method.</p>",
